## User Preferences

### Code Quality Guidelines
- **NEVER use hardcoded sections** - All database IDs, emails, and configuration values must be dynamic
- Always fetch data from Notion API without any hardcoded values or caching
- Different databases have different status schemas - system must detect and handle each database's specific status values and colors
- User is extremely frustrated with any assumptions about data structure - everything must be database-specific
